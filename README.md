# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
This machine learning project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties. Wine quality is a complex sensory attribute that is typically rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating better quality. By building a predictive model, we can help wine producers and enthusiasts assess and improve the quality of their wines.
